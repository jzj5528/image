The 6 entities that I made were pets, enclosure, employees, food, customers and the food for purchase. In this entity relationship, I was trying to display the primary keys like the Pet ID number, enclosure number, employees, serial number, and the  loyalty number. I also connected the boxes based on their relationship. Like the pets are bought by the customers or the pets eat the food. In several of the boxes I also had foreign keys being used and I also connected it to other boxes.\n"
